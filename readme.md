# Unnamed Website PHP Program Thing.
<sub>(Not official or final name.)</sub>

Custom PHP program to run a blog / forum for a website.

## Requirements (Estimation, will update if need be)
- PHP version >= 8.1.0.
- MySQL version >= 8.0.0

PHP must have the mysqli extension enabled for MySQL support.

MySQL should have the following features enabled:
- Ability to create custome routines and functions.
- Ability to partition databases.
- Anything else I can think to add to this later.

## Compiling

PHP is an interpreted language. No compiling needed. What's wrong with you?
